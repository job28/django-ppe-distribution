# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We aim to support the latest minor version on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue, please do **not** open a public issue.
Instead, email the maintainer privately or use the repository's security advisory workflow.
We will acknowledge receipt within a reasonable time and work on a fix.
