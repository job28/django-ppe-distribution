# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

## Getting started
1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.
2. Create a virtualenv and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Make a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
4. Run tests locally before committing.

## Code style
- Follow PEP8 (use `ruff`/`flake8` and `black`).
- Write docstrings for public functions.
- Add/modify tests for new features.

## Commit messages
Use conventional commits when possible:
- `feat: ...` new feature
- `fix: ...` bug fix
- `docs: ...` docs only changes
- `chore: ...` tooling/infra
- `test: ...` add or update tests

## Pull requests
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably small.
- Describe what/why/how in the PR body.
- Link related issues.
